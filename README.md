# Lenny-Bruce-Is-Still-Talking-Dirty-and-Influencing-People
Ronnie Marmo didn’t set out to make a political play when he wrote and starred in “I’m Not a Comedian … I’m Lenny Bruce.” Instead, the actor wanted to depict the complicated style of the counterculture comedian and satirist, who died over 50 years ago. But many have read Mr. Marmo’s performance as a commentary on the Trump era.

Indeed, Mr. Bruce, whose acerbic and profane observations about society inspired generations of comedians who wanted to do more than just tell jokes, is having a pop culture resurgence. In addition to appearing in works for the stage, Mr. Bruce is also a recurring character in Amazon’s Emmy winning TV comedy, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” And over the summer, an exhibit about Mr. Bruce opened at The National Comedy Center in Jamestown, N.Y.
